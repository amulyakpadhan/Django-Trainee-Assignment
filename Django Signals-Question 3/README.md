# Topic: Django Signals Question 3
By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.


## Answer
Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. 


## Steps to Prove:
To prove this, we simulate an error in the signal handler and check whether the entire transaction (including the creation of a User) is rolled back. If the signal is part of the same transaction, the error will cause the user creation to fail. If it runs in a separate transaction, the user will still be created even if the signal handler raises an exception.

Approach:
- We raise an exception inside the signal handler to simulate an error.
- In the view, we attempt to create a User within a transaction.
- After the attempt, we will check whether the User was successfully created by querying the database.
If the signal runs in the same transaction, the exception in the signal handler will roll back the transaction, preventing the user from being saved.

### Signal Handler with Exception
This signal handler raises an exception to simulate a failure.

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def error_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler triggered.")
    raise Exception("Signal handler error")  # Simulate an error

```
### View
This view creates a user and checks whether the transaction was rolled back due to the signal handler error.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.db import transaction

def create_user_view(request):
    user_created = False
    error_message = ""

    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            user = User.objects.create(username='test_user', password='password123')
            print("User creation attempted.")
            user_created = True  # Track if user creation was attempted successfully
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = f"Error: {str(e)}"

    # Check if the user was actually created in the database
    user_exists = User.objects.filter(username='test_user').exists()

    if user_exists:
        return HttpResponse("User was created despite the signal handler error.")
    elif user_created:
        return HttpResponse("User creation failed due to signal handler error, no user was created.")
    else:
        return HttpResponse(error_message)
```

### Test Output 
When accessing the URL mapped to create_user_view, the response will indicate whether the user was created or not:

## Conclusion
Since by triggering an exception in the signal handler and noting that the user creation fails (i.e., the transaction rolls back), this confirms that Django signals operate in the same database transaction as the caller by default.
