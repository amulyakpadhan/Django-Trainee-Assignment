# Django-Trainee-Assignment

**Author:** Amulya Kumar Padhan  
**Assignment:** Django Trainee Technical Round


This repository contains solutions to the technical round tasks assigned as part of the Django Trainee interview process at Accuknox. The tasks cover various aspects of Django signals and Python custom classes. Each folder contains the relevant Django project or Python implementation, with explanations provided in individual `README.md` files.

## Folder Structure and Tasks

1. **Django Signals - Question 1**  
   *Task:* Prove whether Django signals are executed synchronously or asynchronously.  
   *Solution:* This folder contains a Django project where I introduce a delay in a signal handler to determine if the signal runs synchronously. The explanation and the code to verify the behavior are provided in the `README.md` file inside the folder.

2. **Django Signals - Question 2**  
   *Task:* Determine if Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.  
   *Solution:* This folder contains a Django project designed to confirm whether signals execute in the same thread. The explanation and code for verifying the threading behavior are in the `README.md` file inside the folder.

3. **Django Signals - Question 3**  
   *Task:* Verify whether Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller.  
   *Solution:* This folder contains a Django project that demonstrates whether a signal can roll back a database transaction. The explanation and test case are included in the `README.md` file inside the folder.

4. **Topic - Custom Classes in Python**  
   *Task:* Create a custom Python class `Rectangle` that can be iterated over to yield its length and width.  
   *Solution:* This folder contains the implementation of a Python class `Rectangle`, with a custom iterator. The detailed explanation and code are provided in the `README.md` file inside the folder.
