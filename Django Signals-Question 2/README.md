# Topic: Django Signals Question 2
Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.


## Answer
Django signals are executed in the same thread as the caller by default.


## Steps to Prove:
To prove this, we will create a signal handler that logs the name of the current thread when it is called. Then, in our view, we will create a user and log the thread name as well. By comparing the two, we can confirm whether they are executed in the same thread.

### Signal Handler
The signal handler logs the current thread's name when it is triggered.

```python
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def thread_logging_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    current_thread = threading.current_thread().name
    print(f"Signal handler executed in thread: {current_thread}")

```
### View
The view creates a new User and logs the thread name before and after the user creation to compare.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.http import HttpResponse
import threading

def create_user_view(request):
    current_thread = threading.current_thread().name
    print(f"View executed in thread: {current_thread}")

    # Creating a new user, which triggers the post_save signal
    user = User.objects.create(username='new_test_user1', password='12345')

    return HttpResponse("User created.")
```

### Test Output 
When you access the URL that maps to the create_user_view, the output will include the thread names from both the view and the signal handler:



## Conclusion
Since both the view and the signal handler log the same thread name which is Thread-1 (process_request_thread), this confirms that Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default.
